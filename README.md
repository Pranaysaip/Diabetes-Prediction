# Diabetes-Prediction
üöÄ I'm thrilled to share a project I worked on, I had the incredible opportunity to work on a diabetes prediction system using cutting-edge AI/ML neural networks. Developing this system was a transformative experience, shedding light on the potential of machine learning in improving health outcomes

üîç Project Overview:
The objective was to develop a predictive model that identifies individuals at risk of diabetes by analyzing various health metrics. Utilizing Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and other data science libraries, I built and trained a neural network with multiple dense layers and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The model achieved 82% accuracy on the test dataset.This project involved data preprocessing, feature scaling, model development, training, and evaluation. I integrated the model into a Django web application for user-friendly predictions .

This experience has been incredibly rewarding, highlighting the transformative potential of AI/ML in healthcare.
